## Background:
Since 2012, Superstore has collected data on sales, customers, products, etc. Although the data is regularly collected in their Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems, the reporting team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. Their process consisted of manually pulling data from the ERP and CRM and manipulating it in Excel. Initially, this workflow worked, but as their company grew, the data grew along with it and Excel started to slow down. As a result, reports started having longer turnarounds, the reporting team became overworked, and executives got restless. 
One day, the data reached the maximum number of rows workable in Excel and reporting was brought to a screeching halt. The executives lost visibility into their business, management could not measure their KPIs, and analysts could not develop reports. The CEO and other high-level executives had a number of questions on the performance of their company but could not get their team to provide thorough insights, so they decided to get help from BACC to fix its data pipeline, automate standard reports, and ask deeper questions.
